    By pulling in data on a weekly basis  this can lead to missing reports. This is due to the lab having to re-run assay or a hold up in the lab. The perfered method for doing an automated pull that
    factors in the reflexing would be a monthly pull or a daily pull. Since this was weekly, I went ahead and wrote a script that pulls in all of the previous reports, filters those reports out, and then gives 
    me the reports that need to go out for that week. Lastly, I wrapped this in a try except in case a report threw an error with the filtering.
